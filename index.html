        <h2>Goose</h2>
        <p>
            A <b style="color: darkgreen;"> goose</b> (plural geese) is a bird of any of several waterfowl species in the family Anatidae.. <br/>
            This group comprises the genera Anser (the grey geese and white geese) and Branta (the black geese).<br/>
            Some other birds, mostly related to the shelducks, have "goose" as part of their names. <br/>
            More distantly related members of the family Anatidae are swans, most of which are larger than true geese,
            and ducks, which are smaller.<br/>

        <h3>More Geese</h3>
        <p>
            The term "goose" may refer to either a male or female bird, but when paired with "gander", refers specifically to a female one 
            (the latter referring to a male). Young birds before fledging are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goose">goslings</a>. <br/>
            The collective noun for a group of geese on the ground is a gaggle; when in flight, they are called a skein, a team, or a wedge;<br/>
            when flying close together, they are called a plump.
